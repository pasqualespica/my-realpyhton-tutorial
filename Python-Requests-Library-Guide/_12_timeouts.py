# When you make an inline request to an external service, your system will need to wait upon the response before moving on. If your application waits too long for that response, requests to your service could back up, your user experience could suffer, or your background jobs could hang.

# By default, requests will wait indefinitely on the response, so you should almost always specify a timeout duration to prevent these things from happening. To set the requestâ€™s timeout, use the timeout parameter. timeout can be an integer or float representing the number of seconds to wait on a response before timing out:

"""
requests.get('https://api.github.com', timeout=1)

requests.get('https://api.github.com', timeout=3.05)

"""


# In the first request, the request will timeout after 1 second. In the second request, the request will timeout after 3.05 seconds.

# You can also pass a tuple to timeout with the first element being a connect timeout (the time it allows for the client to establish a connection to the server), and the second being a read timeout (the time it will wait on a response once your client has established a connection):

# >>> requests.get('https://api.github.com', timeout=(2, 5))
# <Response [200]>
# If the request establishes a connection within 2 seconds and receives data within 5 seconds of the connection being established, then the response will be returned as it was before. If the request times out, then the function will raise a Timeout exception:

import requests
from requests.exceptions import Timeout

try:
    response = requests.get('https://api.github.com', timeout=1)
except Timeout:
    print('The request timed out')
else:
    print('The request did not time out')
