https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

When you pass your username and password in a tuple to the auth parameter, requests is applying the credentials using HTTPâ€™s Basic access authentication scheme under the hood.

Therefore, you could make the same request by passing explicit Basic authentication credentials using HTTPBasicAuth:

"""

from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
requests.get( 'https://api.github.com/user', auth=HTTPBasicAuth('username', getpass() ))
