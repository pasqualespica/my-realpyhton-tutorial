# Writing CSV File From a Dictionary With csv
# Unlike DictReader, the fieldnames parameter is required when writing a dictionary. 
# This makes sense, when you think about it: without a list of fieldnames, 
# the DictWriter canâ€™t know which keys to use to retrieve values 
# from your dictionaries. It also uses the keys in fieldnames 
# to write out the first row as column names
with open('employee_file2.csv', mode='w') as csv_file:
